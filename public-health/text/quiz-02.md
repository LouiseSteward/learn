	- 	It is not important if the diseases are common
	-	 It helps to know whether staff have a good reason to be absent from work
	+ 	It is useful to plan services
	- 	In private practice it helps to know how much to charge patients

	- 	How serious is a disease
	+	How common is a disease
	- 	How expensive it is the treat the disease
	- 	How many people are at risk of dying from the disease
3.	Incidence of a disease is a measure of:
	- 	How many people with the disease are in hospital
	- 	How many people have died of the disease
	+	How many new cases are there of the disease
	- 	How infectious is the disease
4.	How is incidence and prevalence related?
	- 	When incidence increases the prevalence usually falls
	+	When incidence increases the prevalence usually also increases
	- 	When the incidence falls the prevalence rapidly become zero
	- 	There is no relationship between incidence and prevalence
5.	What is the burden of disease?
	+	The impact of the disease on the community
	- 	The cost of preventing a disease
	- 	The number of obese people in the community
	- 	A screening system to make sure that the sickest people are seen first at a clinic
6.	Calculating a DALY depends on:
	- 	The number of people living in the community
	- 	The number of years of employment lost from the disease
	- 	The number of years lived before the start of the disease
	+	Both the number of years lost plus years lived with disability as a result of a condition.
7.	How are DALYs used in practice?
	- 	To compare different patients
	- 	To compare different services
	- 	To compare different communities
	+	To compare different countries or health regions
8.	What does a QALY measure?
	- 	The standard of service provided in a clinic
	- 	The quality of care in hospital
	+	Health gained over years
	- 	An assessment of the cost of providing care
9.	Caseload is a measure of:
	+	The number and type of patients seen at a facility
	- 	The number of patients who die in a facility
	- 	The number of patients who pay for services at a facility
	- 	The number of patients who complain of poor service in a facility
10.	What is an ICD code?
	- 	An international code of service quality
	- 	A South African code of healthcare practice
	+	A classification of diseases or conditions
	- 	A method of speaking confidentially to colleagues in front of a patient
11.	What is public health surveillance?
	- 	Making a video of the public as they enter a health facility
	- 	Counting the number of patients in hospital beds
	+	Monitoring the pattern of disease
	- 	Recording clinic attendance
12.	What is traditional surveillance?
	- 	Surveillance using cameras to record patient numbers
	- 	Surveillance that monitors symptoms and signs of illness
	+	Surveillance that tracks diagnosed conditions
	- 	Surveillance that depends on patients to report their conditions
13.	Syndromic surveillance depends on many sources including:
	- 	ICD coding in a clinic
	- 	Laboratory results
	- 	Records of common notifiable conditions
	+	Pharmacy sales
14.	How is the mean determined?
	- 	It is the largest number in a set of data
	- 	It is the smallest number in a set of data
	- 	It is the commonest number in a set of data
	+	It is the sum of all the values added together and then divided by the number of values
15.	What is a median?
	+	It is the “middle number” in a data set, arranged from the largest to the smallest
	- 	It is the difference between the highest and lowest number in a data set
	- 	It is the same as a mean
	- 	It is the same as the mode
16.	What is the mode?
	- 	It is the furthest outlier in a data set
	+	It is the commonest value in a data set
	- 	It is the difference between the highest and lowest value in a data set
	- 	It is the sum of all the values added together
17.	What is the value of knowing the standard deviation?
	+	It indicates the spread of the data around the mean
	- 	It indicates the spread of data around the median
	- 	It indicates the spread of data around the mode
	- 	It has very little value and is not used when analysing clinical data
18.	The range of results is usually used with:
	- 	Means
	+	Medians
	- 	Modes
	- 	Both means and modes
19.	How should outliers be handled?
	- 	If there is only one it can be ignored to clean the data set
	- 	Up to 10% of the total number of very high or low values can be ignored
	- 	Only ignore outliers if there are both high and low values
	+	Outliers should not be ignored but explored
20.	What is a proportion?
	- 	It is the total number of values in a data set
	+	It consists of a numerator divided by a denominator
	- 	It consists of a denominator divided by a numerator
	-	It is the numerator multiplied by the denominator
